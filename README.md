# AnimePlanet Additions
Adding new features / fixing minor inconveniences that i have found in animeplanet. 
You can disable/enable features in the options page of the addon. Options page in firefox is at about:addons and in chromium its browser://extensions.

## Installation

When installed you need to allow the addon to operate in animeplanet url. And if you want to use "Extra manga data" script that uses mangaupdates api then you need to also allow the script to work in mangaupdates url.

### Firefox
You can find the extension for Firefox on Mozilla's add-on page: [AnimePlanet Additions](https://github.com/Sandelier/AnimePlanet-Additions)
In the extensions list you need to allow the addon access to animeplanet url. Otherwise the extension wont be able to inject content scripts to the page which basically means it wont work.

### Chromium
For Chromium browsers like Chrome or brave, you need to download the zip file from [Releases](https://github.com/Sandelier/AnimePlanet-Additions/releases/latest) and manually add it to Chromium since Google wants me to pay them if i want it to be published in their own web store.
