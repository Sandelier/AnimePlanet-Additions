# AnimePlanet Additions
Adding new features / fixing minor inconveniences that i have found in animeplanet. 

Gonna add chromium someday. (Don't trust me on this one) 

## Installation

**Permissions:**
- You need to allow the extension to operate in Animeplanet's url so that we can inject content scripts.
- If you want to use the "Extra manga data" script then you need to also allow the extension to operate in mangaupdates api url.

### Firefox
Extension can be found in Mozilla's add-on page: [AnimePlanet Additions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/animeplanet-additions/)

### Options page
You can disable/enable features in the options page of the addon. Options page in firefox is at about:addons and in chromium its browser://extensions.

### Acknowledgements
* **Mangaupdates** ([https://api.mangaupdates.com/](https://api.mangaupdates.com/)): Mangaupdates api is used for "Extra manga data" feature to fetch manga data
* **Chart.js** ([https://www.chartjs.org/](https://www.chartjs.org/)): Chart.js is used to make charts lot easier in option page.
