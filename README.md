# AnimePlanet Additions
Adding new features / fixing minor inconveniences that i have found in animeplanet. 
You can disable/enable features in the options page of the addon. Options page in firefox is at about:addons and in chromium its browser://extensions.

## Installation

### Firefox
You can find the extension for Firefox on Mozilla's add-on page: [AnimePlanet Additions](https://github.com/Sandelier/AnimePlanet-Additions)

### Chromium
I am in the process of changing the code to make it work on chromium.

In the extensions list you need to allow the addon to work in animeplanet url.
